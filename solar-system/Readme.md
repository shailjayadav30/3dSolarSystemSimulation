# 3D Solar System Simulation

A mobile-responsive 3D simulation of the solar system built using Three.js, a JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser. This project features the Sun, all 8 planets (Mercury to Neptune), realistic lighting, orbital animations, and interactive controls, all implemented with pure JavaScript without CSS animations.

## Features
- 3D rendering of the Sun and planets with realistic textures.
- Orbital animation for each planet with adjustable speeds.
- Control panel with sliders to adjust individual planet speeds in real-time.
- Pause/Resume animation button.
- Background stars for a cosmic effect.
- Tooltips on hover over planets or the Sun.
- Camera zoom on click for closer inspection.
- Dark mode theme with a transparent control panel at the bottom (horizontal on mobile).
- Fully responsive design for all modern browsers and mobile devices.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/shailjayadav30/3dSolarSystemSimulation.git
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   - Change into the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd solar-system
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install the required npm packages:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - This will install Three.js and other dependencies specified in `package.json`.

4. **Run the Project**
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL provided in the terminal).

## Usage
- Use the sliders in the control panel to adjust the orbital speed of each planet.
- Click the "Pause" button to stop/resume the animation.
- Hover over a planet or the Sun to see its name in a tooltip.
- Click a planet or the Sun to zoom the camera toward it.
- The control panel is located at the bottom in a horizontal layout on mobile devices for better visibility of the 3D scene.
